Greyscale images are stored in 2D form which means that,Height and Width are used to represent.

Colored images are stored in 3D form which consists of Height, Width and Color_Channels.

Color_Channels are represented in different ways and are called "Colorspaces".

List of some Colorspaces(Refer to P2 in Matplotlib):

1)RGB(RED,GREEN,BLUE)/(255,255,255).

2)BGR(BLUE,GREEN,RED).

3)HSV(Hue Saturation Value).

4)CMY(Cayan,Magenta,Yellow).

5)Greyscale.

Below are some of the MOST commanly used color conversions(Refer to P3 in Matplotlib.):

1)COLOR_BGR2GRAY

2)COLOR_BGR2HSV

3)COLOR_BGR2RGB
